# Chief ⚔️

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/chief_version-v4.0.0-blue)

**English** | **[ไทย](README.th.md)**

A structured workflow for AI coding agents. Drop it into any project, set your rules once, and stop re-explaining your codebase every chat.

> Chief is part of the [chief-tribe](https://github.com/thaitype/chief-tribe) ecosystem. It uses [sage](https://github.com/thaitype/sage) as its behavioral baseline.

## Why Chief exists

Every project has context — the decisions from six months ago, the weird workaround, all the "why we do it this way" stuff. It lives in your head. Every new AI chat starts blank, so you re-explain. Then again next chat.

Chief stops that. Give every project the same shape — `AGENTS.md` for rules, `.chief/_rules/` for standards, `.chief/milestone-N/` for current work. Agents know where to read and write. Your prompts shrink to one sentence.

→ [Why Chief exists](docs/manual/explanation/why-chief.md)

## Quickstart

**Step 1 — Install skills:**

```bash
npx skills@latest add thaitype/chief
```

Select the skills you want. Make sure `chief-install` is included.

**Step 2 — Run `/chief-install` in your agent:**

```
/chief-install
```

It asks which coding agent you use, whether to symlink or copy, and whether to include subagents. That's it.

**Step 3 — Bootstrap project context (optional):**

```
/chief-init
```

Interviews you about your stack and dev commands, writes `.chief/project.md`. Skip it and write the file by hand later if you prefer.

> **Windows users:** Symlink mode requires Developer Mode and `git config --global core.symlinks true`. The install skill auto-detects and falls back to copy mode.

## How Chief works

Chief is markdown files in three places:

```
project/
├── AGENTS.md          ← framework + project rules (highest authority)
└── .chief/
    ├── project.md     ← tech stack, dev commands (written by /chief-init)
    ├── _rules/        ← standards that apply across all milestones
    └── milestone-1/   ← current work: goals, contracts, tasks
```

`.chief/` is created lazily — nothing appears until you need it.

**Rules hierarchy:** `AGENTS.md` > `.chief/_rules/` > `.chief/milestone-N/_goal/`. Higher always wins.

→ [Rules hierarchy](docs/manual/reference/rules-hierarchy.md)
→ [Directory structure](docs/manual/reference/directory-structure.md)

## Working styles

### Controlled — review every step

Best for complex projects, unfamiliar domains, team work.

```
/chief-plan        # grill → goals → contracts → TODO → tasks (approval at each step)
builder-agent: implement task-1 from milestone-1
/chief-retro       # review and capture lessons as rules
```

### Autonomous — let AI drive

Best for prototyping, well-defined goals, solo work.

```
/chief-autopilot   # reads goals + contracts, runs all tasks
/chief-retro
```

### Mix and match

```
/chief-plan        # plan with approval gates
/chief-autopilot   # execute the approved plan
/chief-retro
```

## Agents

| Agent                     | Role                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `chief-agent`           | Plans, orchestrates, delegates — does not write code  |
| `builder-agent`         | Implements tasks, runs unit tests, commits             |
| `tester-agent`          | Integration/E2E validation — only when you request it |
| `answer-verifier-agent` | Background verifier spawned by `/chief-grill`        |
